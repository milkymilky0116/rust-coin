## Achieved

  - [x] #4.2 Our First Blockchain
  - [x] #4.3 Singleton Pattern
  - [x] #4.4 - 4.5 Refactoring

- Section 5: Explorer

#### in this section, i'm using [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for web framework, [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama/tree/main) for template engine.

#### Since _Askama_ behaves differently compared to _Golang Template engine_, I couldn't achieve 100% replicate from original source code. (like head, footer partial)

- [x] #5.1 Rendering Templates
- [x] #5.2 Rendering Blocks
